# Mapping_Earthquakes

work in progress
Assignment 14

## Purpose

Using HTML, JavaScript and Leaflet, collect and deploy geoJSON data to create maps displaying the locations of earthquakes, with markers sized to reflect the magnitude.

Three layers are developed: one showing plate boundaries, one showing all earthquakes, and one showing all earthquakes > 4.5.
